## Description

For now it's only a Proof of Concept using [Aspect Oriented Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming "AOP on Wikipedia") in PHP.
### Base parts
1. Inject extra code to existed classes (Proxy classes)
2. Made any object injectable (IoC container)
3. Common framework for adding extra code (AOP)

## How to use
Look at the *demos* folder
* config.xml - IoC configuration
* test.php - Test script

Create and make writable *demos/proxy*, run *php test.php*

## How it works
Look at source ;)
